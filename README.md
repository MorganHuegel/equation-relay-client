3. Run the command `npm install` If you don't have Node/npm installed, go [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
4. Run the command `node server.js`

5. `CD` into new location and clone this repo
6. `CD` into this repo
7. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) (it's basically the same as npm, but cooler)
8. Run `yarn install`
9. Run `yarn start`
